## Void Keyword
The void keyword allows us to create methods which do not return a value

## Passing Parameters By Value
Passing Parameters by Value means calling a method with a parameter. Through this, the argument value is passed to the parameter.

## Method Overloading
When a class has two or more methods by the same name but different parameters, it is known as method overloading. It is different from overriding. In overriding, a method has the same method name, type, number of parameters, etc

## Finalize Method
The finalize() method of Object class is a method that the Garbage Collector always calls just before the deletion/destroying the object which is eligible for Garbage Collection, so as to perform clean-up activity. Clean-up activity means closing the resources associated with that object like Database Connection, Network Connection or we can say resource de-allocation. Remember it is not a reserved keyword. Once the finalize method completes immediately Garbage Collector destroy that object.
