# Numbers

Normally, when we work with Numbers, we use primitive data types such as byte, int, long, double, etc.

However, in development, we come across situations where we need to use objects instead of primitive data types. In order to achieve this, Java provides wrapper classes.

All the wrapper classes (Integer, Long, Byte, Double, Float, Short) are subclasses of the abstract class Number.

Integer x = 5; // boxes int to an Integer object

x =  x + 10;   // unboxes the Integer to a int
