# Conditional Statements

## If Statement
An if statement consists of a boolean expression followed by one or more statements.

## If-Else Statement
An if statement can be followed by an optional else statement, which executes when the boolean expression is false.

## Nested If Statement
You can use one if or else if statement inside another if or else if statement(s).

## Switch Statement
A switch statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values.

# Loops

## While Loop

Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is true. It tests the condition before executing the loop body

## For Loop

Execute a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable.

## Do...While Loop

Like a while statement, except that it tests the condition at the end of the loop body.


# Loop Control Statements

## Break Statement
Terminates the loop or switch statement and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop or switch.

## Continue Statement
Causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and immediately retest its condition prior to reiterating.
